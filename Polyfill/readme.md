# Polyfill

A polyfill is a piece of code that helps to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.

## The Need for Polyfills

- New features : Polyfills enables to use cutting-edge functions of a web platform or programming language in older browsers or environments that don't support them.
- Browser Compatibility: The latest features of a programming language or web platform may not be supported by all browsers and environments, which can cause compatibility problems. Polyfills helps in ensuring that the code functions consistently on various browsers and gadgets.

### Benefits of Using Polyfills

- **Better User Experience:** Polyfills allow developers to improve user experience by adding features and capabilities, even in older browsers.

- **Enhanced security:** Using polyfills can also increase security by offering a different implementation of a feature that might have security flaws in earlier browser versions.

- **Better cross-browser compatibility:** Polyfills enable programmers to use new capabilities of a programming language or web platform in situations or environments that don't support them, ensuring that their code functions reliably across various browsers and devices.

- **Future-proofing:** By incorporating new capabilities that might become standards in upcoming iterations of the programming language or web platform, developers can future-proof their code by utilising polyfills.

### Common Browser Features Where Polyfills Are Used

- SVG
- Canvas
- Web Storage (local storage / session storage)
- Video
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
- HTML5 elements
- CSS responsive design modules

#### Disadvantages of using polyfills

- slow down the performance of web applications if they are not used correctly
- it adds additional code to a web page, which can increase the file size and slow down page load times
- Polyfills may need to be updated or replaced as newer versions of JavaScript are released, which can create maintenance issues for developers.
